    Parameters
    ----------
        server_address: str. The IPv6 address of the server. If the Flower
            server runs on the same machine on port 8080, then `server_address`
            would be `"[::]:8080"`.
        client: flwr.client.Client. An implementation of the abstract base
            class `flwr.client.Client`.
        grpc_max_message_length: int (default: 536_870_912, this equals 512MB).
            The maximum length of gRPC messages that can be exchanged with the
            Flower server. The default should be sufficient for most models.
            Users who train very large models might need to increase this
            value. Note that the Flower server needs to be started with the
            same value (see `flwr.server.start_server`), otherwise it will not
            know about the increased limit and block larger messages.
        root_certificates: bytes (default: None)
            The PEM-encoded root certificates as a byte string. If provided, a secure
            connection using the certificates will be established to a
            SSL-enabled Flower server.
